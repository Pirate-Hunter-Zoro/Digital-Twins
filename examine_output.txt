üîç Closest Neighbors (later is closer):
  1. ID: (P0000001, 2), Cosine Similarity: 0.9408
    Patient Narrative: The patient was diagnosed with elevated fasting blood sugar (R73.9) and initiated on Metformin. Their treatment plan includes routine bloodwork, insulin titration follow-ups, and a structured diet and exercise regimen to manage metabolic health. This suggests a focus on addressing pre-diabetic or early diabetic indicators through medication and lifestyle interventions.

  2. ID: (P0000001, 4), Cosine Similarity: 0.9561
    Patient Narrative: The patient has a history of abnormal metabolic findings (R73.9) and was initially managed with Metformin, insulin titration, and lifestyle changes. Over time, they developed type 2 diabetes (E11), low back pain (M54.5), and anxiety (F41.1), with medications including insulin, Albuterol, and additional therapies for comorbidities like GERD (K21.9) and hypertension (Hydrochlorothiazide). Recent care includes cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety and ongoing diabetes management.

üß≠ Farthest Neighbors (later is farther):
  1. ID: (P0000002, 4), Cosine Similarity: 0.8840
    Patient Narrative: The patient's medical journey includes initial management of anxiety (F41.1) with Metformin and sleep hygiene education. Subsequent visits revealed hypertension (I10), type 2 diabetes (E11), and elevated TSH (R73.9), leading to addictions of Albuterol, Atorvastatin, and Lisinopril, alongside a diet/exercise plan. In the latest visit, they received Gabapentin for neuropathic pain (M54.5), initiated insulin titration for diabetes, and began cognitive behavioral therapy, indicating complex comorbidities requiring multidisciplinary care.

  2. ID: (P0000002, 3), Cosine Similarity: 0.8662
    Patient Narrative: The patient initially presented with an anxiety disorder (F41.1) and was prescribed Metformin, alongside sleep hygiene education. Subsequent visits revealed the development of hypertension (I10), with adjustments to medications including Albuterol, Atorvastatin, and Lisinopril, alongside a diet and exercise plan to manage cardiovascular risk factors. Their care has evolved from addressing anxiety and diabetes to managing hypertension and comorbid conditions through lifestyle and pharmacological interventions.


üéØ Target Patient Narrative (up to Visit 3):
The patient was initially diagnosed with an unspecified metabolic disorder (R73.9) and started on Metformin for diabetes management, along with insulin titration and lifestyle modifications. In the subsequent visit, they developed low back pain (M54.5) and GERD (K21.9), with additional medications including Atorvastatin and Hydrochlorothiazide, while continuing diet/exercise plans and sleep hygiene education. Their care has evolved to address comorbidities alongside ongoing diabetes management.
